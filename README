Infrastructure automation code for reproducing a production like environment for Edutrac

You need to install the following on your system 
1. VirtualBox
2. Vagrant

Instructions 
1. After installing Vagrant and Virtual Box
2. create the edtrac_box virtual box by running this command 
	vagrant box add edtrac_box /path/to/your/vagrantimage.box
	(the path could be a url to the box or path on the filesystem if you have the box downloaded on your machine)
3. vagrant init on the root of edtrack_provisioning.
4. Replace the contents of  Vagrantfile by those in Vagrantfile.example
5. Edit the Vagrantfile -> uncomment and update the line of synced_folder to map the edtrac project to /vagrant
6. Edit the Vagrantfile and point to the path to your vagrantbox if you have it on your machine if  you don't, (Skip this step) you will need a good network connection though.
7. Edit the Vagrantfile and point to the path to your cookbooks e.g ~/your_username/chef-repos/edtrac_provisioning/cookbooks/  
8. Now run vagrant up and you are good to go!

NOTE:

After a successfull provisioning, you may want to avoid provisioning every time you boot vagrant with out re-provisioning. 
To do so boot vagrant using the command below:

vagrant up --no-provision
